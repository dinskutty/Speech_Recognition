# Speech-recognition
1. Converting speech into text using python with google web speech.
2. Also it supports an audio file as input 
3. Final output text convert into word file

## Supported File Types
Currently, SpeechRecognition supports the following file formats:

* WAV: must be in PCM/LPCM format
* AIFF
* AIFF-C
* FLAC: must be native FLAC format; OGG-FLAC is not supported

If you are working on x-86 based Linux, macOS or Windows, you should be able to work with FLAC files without a problem. On other platforms, you will need to install a FLAC encoder and ensure you have access to the flac command line tool. You can find more information here if this applies to you.
